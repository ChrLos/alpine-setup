- [ ] for get_user() in [checkStart.sh](https://github.com/ChrLos/alpine-setup/blob/main/lib/checkStart.sh) : The auto guess_name will need work if there's 2 users, make a dialog to select which user
- [ ] Remove Homepage and make them auto instead, or just choose:
  - Minimal Setup (Without pipewire and DE)
  - Full Setup (Functional Normal OS)
- [ ]  Automatic VS Code Setup (the setting and auto apply themes, if possible)
- [ ]  Fix NodeJS auto download not working
- [ ]  Maybe make another .sh specifically for dynamic UI creation and delete from [dynamicOption.sh](https://github.com/ChrLos/alpine-setup/blob/main/lib/dynamicOption.sh)
